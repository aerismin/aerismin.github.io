    <p>The indoor Teahouse is now open.<br>
        Our building was formerly used as the Beaverton Chamber of Commerce building in the 1960's. We are proud to restore and convert this cozy space in Beaverton for the use of our teahouse.</p>

    <p>Our outdoor tea garden is currently a work in progress and will be opening soon. The outdoor tea garden will feature lush outdoor seating under a giant historic Oak tree, with live music in the summer.</p>
